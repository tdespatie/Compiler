# Compiler written in C
I wrote a compiler for the PLATYPUS language that contains a buffer structure, lexical analyzer (scanner), symbol table, and parser. The PLATYPUS language was created by my compiler's professor. I had to develop the grammar structure listed in the GrammerProductions.rtf document.

The .pls files in this repository are functions written in the PLATYPUS language.
